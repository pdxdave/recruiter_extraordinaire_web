        text: `A retained search is an exclusive collaboration
               with your organization.  We team up with management
               , human resources and members of engineering to do
               a deep dive into your company culture, tech stack, and
               operations.  Together we identify exactly what kind of
               candidate will offer the most value and create a long
               lasting, positive impact for your organization.`

        text: `Sometimes a long-term, full-time engineer is not what 
               an organization needs. Instead, they may just need a 
               highly qualified individual who can come in, work a 
               little magic to clean up a project, or perhaps offer 
               some needed guidance. We have a large resource of candidates
               who are specifically interested in short-term, contract opportunities.`

        text: `We start by digging into our large database of candidates
               we have spoken with over the years and identify those that
               would be the best fit for your opportunity. We match them 
               technically and geographically (if possible). If they are 
               committed to projects they canâ€™t leave, these same candidates
               often refer us to passive candidates whom they believe 
               would be a strong technical match for your opportunity.`
